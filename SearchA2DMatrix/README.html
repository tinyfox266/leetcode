    <h1>Search a 2D Matrix</h1>
<p>Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties:</p>
<p>Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.</p>
<h1>For example</h1>
<p>Consider the following matrix:
<pre>
[
  [1,   3,  5,  7],
  [10, 11, 16, 20],
  [23, 30, 34, 50]
]
</pre>
Given target = 3, return true.</p>
