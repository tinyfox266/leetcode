# Word Break 
Given a string s and a dictionary of words dict, determine if s can be segmented
into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

# For example
given

s = "leetcode",

dict = ["leet", "code"].

Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".

# Note
* reduce the duplicate cases: for example, the input is wordDict = ["aaaa","aa"]
  and s = "aaaaaaa"
