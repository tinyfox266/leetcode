#String to Integer (atoi) 
Implement atoi to convert a string to an integer.

# Hint: 
Carefully consider all possible input cases. If you want a challenge,
please do not see below and ask yourself what are the possible input cases.

# Notes: 
It is intended for this problem to be specified vaguely (ie, no given
input specs). You are responsible to gather all the input requirements up front

* input is "123ab5", output is "123"
* input is "    10522545459", output is "2147483647"
* input is "2147483648", output is "2147483647"
* input is "-2147483648", output is "-2147483648"
* Note the boundry of the integer value
* Note how to judge whether the result value is exceed the value of
    integer(both the maximum and the minimum value)
