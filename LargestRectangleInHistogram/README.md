# Largest Rectangle in Histogram 
Given n non-negative integers representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, find the area of largest rectangle in the histogram.

<img alt="histogram" src="images/histogram.png" width="300"/>

Above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1, given height = [2,1,5,6,2,3].

<img alt="histogram_area" src="images/histogram_area.png" width="300"/>

The largest rectangle is shown in the shaded area, which has area = 10 unit.

# For example
Given height = [2,1,5,6,2,3],

return 10.
