    <h1>Sort Colors</h1>
<p>Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them so that
objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white
and blue.</p>
<p>Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white,
and blue respectively.</p>
<h1>Note:</h1>
<p>You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.</p>
