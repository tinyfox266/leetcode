    <h1>Isomorphic Strings</h1>
<p>Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.</p>
<p>Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.</p>
<p>All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while
preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same
character but a character may map to itself.</p>
<h1>For example,</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Given "egg", "add", return true.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given "foo", "bar", return false.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given "paper", "title", return true.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Note:</h1>
<ul>
<li>You may assume both s and t have the same length.</li>
<li>if s and t are isomorphic, then t and s must be isomorphic  too.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Problem Encounter</h1>
<ul>
<li>An object cannot be compared with a primitive value.</li>
</ul>
