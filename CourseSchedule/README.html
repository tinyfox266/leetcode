    <h1>Course Schedule</h1>
<p>There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n - 1.</p>
<p>Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to
first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]</p>
<p>Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it
possible for you to finish all courses?</p>
<h1>For example:</h1>
<p>2, [[1,0]]
There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have
finished course 0. So it is possible.</p>
<p>2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have
finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1.
So it is impossible.</p>

<p>The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency
matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.</p>
