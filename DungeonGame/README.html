    <h1>Dungeon Game</h1>
<p>The demons had captured the princess (P) and imprisoned her in the bottom-right
corner of a dungeon. The dungeon consists of M x N rooms laid out in a 2D grid.
Our valiant knight (K) was initially positioned in the top-left room and must
fight his way through the dungeon to rescue the princess.</p>
<p>The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at
any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately.</p>
<p>Some of the rooms are guarded by demons, so the knight loses health (negative
integers) upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (0's) or
contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (positive integers).</p>
<p>In order to reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to
move only rightward or downward in each step.</p>
<p>Write a function to determine the knight's minimum initial health so that he is
able to rescue the princess.</p>
<h1>For example</h1>
<p>given the dungeon below, the initial health of the knight must be
at least 7 if he follows the optimal path RIGHT-&gt; RIGHT -&gt; DOWN -&gt; DOWN.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>-2 (K)</th>
<th>-3</th>
<th>3</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>-5</td>
<td>-10</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10</td>
<td>30</td>
<td>-5 (P)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h1>Notes:</h1>
<p>The knight's health has no upper bound.
Any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters
and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.</p>
