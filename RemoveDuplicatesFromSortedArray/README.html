    <h1>Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array</h1>
<p>Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in place such that each element
appear only once and return the new length.</p>
<p>Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with
constant memory.</p>
<h1>For example,</h1>
<p>Given input array nums = [1,1,2],</p>
<p>Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums
being 1 and 2 respectively. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new
length.</p>
