    <h1>Repeated DNA Sequences</h1>
<p>All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as A, C, G, and T,
for example: "ACGAATTCCG". When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to identify
repeated sequences within the DNA.</p>
<p>Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that
occur more than once in a DNA molecule.</p>
<h1>For example</h1>
<p>Given s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT",</p>
<p>Return:</p>
<p>["AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"].</p>
