# Symmetric Tree
Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric
around its center).

# For example 
this binary tree is symmetric:
<pre>
    1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3
</pre>
But the following is not:
<pre>
   1
   / \
  2   2
   \   \
   3    3
</pre>

# Note:
* Bonus points if you could solve it both recursively and iteratively.
