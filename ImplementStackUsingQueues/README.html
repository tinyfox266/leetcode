    <h1>Implement Stack using Queues</h1>
<p>Implement the following operations of a stack using queues.</p>
<ul>
<li>push(x) -- Push element x onto stack.</li>
<li>pop() -- Removes the element on top of the stack.</li>
<li>top() -- Get the top element.</li>
<li>empty() -- Return whether the stack is empty.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Notes:</h1>
<ul>
<li>You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or top operations will be called on an empty stack).</li>
<li>Depending on your language, queue may not be supported natively. You may simulate a queue by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a queue -- which means only push to back, pop from front, size, and is empty operations are valid.</li>
</ul>
