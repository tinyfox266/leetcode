    <h1>Course Schedule II</h1>
<p>There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n - 1.</p>
<p>Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to
first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]</p>
<p>Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, return the
ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses.</p>
<p>There may be multiple correct orders, you just need to return one of them. If it
is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.</p>
<h1>For example</h1>
<p>2, [[1,0]]</p>
<p>There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have
finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1]</p>
<p>4, [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]</p>
<p>There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have
finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you
finished course 0. So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct
ordering is[0,2,1,3].</p>
