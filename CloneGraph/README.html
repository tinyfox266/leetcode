    <h1>Clone Graph</h1>
<p>Clone an undirected graph. Each node in the graph contains a label and a list of its neighbors.</p>
<p>OJ's undirected graph serialization:</p>
<p>Nodes are labeled uniquely.</p>
<p>We use # as a separator for each node, and , as a separator for node label and each neighbor of the node.</p>
<p>As an example, consider the serialized graph {0,1,2#1,2#2,2}.</p>
<p>The graph has a total of three nodes, and therefore contains three parts as separated by #.</p>
<ul>
<li>First node is labeled as 0. Connect node 0 to both nodes 1 and 2.</li>
<li>Second node is labeled as 1. Connect node 1 to node 2.</li>
<li>Third node is labeled as 2. Connect node 2 to node 2 (itself), thus forming a self-cycle.</li>
<li>Visually, the graph looks like the following:</li>
</ul>
