    <h1>3Sum Closest</h1>
<p>Given an array S of n integers, find three integers in S such that the sum is
closest to a given number, target. Return the sum of the three integers. You may
assume that each input would have exactly one solution.</p>
<h1>For example</h1>
<p>given array S = {-1 2 1 -4}, and target = 1.</p>
<p>The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).</p>
