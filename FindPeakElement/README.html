    <h1>Find Peak Element</h1>
<p>A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors.</p>
<p>Given an input array where num[i] ≠ num[i+1], find a peak element and return its index.</p>
<p>The array may contain multiple peaks, in that case return the index to any one of the peaks is fine.</p>
<p>You may imagine that num[-1] = num[n] = -∞.</p>
<h1>For example</h1>
<p>in array [1, 2, 3, 1], 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.</p>
<h1>Note:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Your solution should be in logarithmic complexity.</li>
</ul>
