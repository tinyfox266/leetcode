    <h1>Insert Interval</h1>
<p>Given a set of non-overlapping intervals, insert a new interval into the
intervals (merge if necessary).</p>
<p>You may assume that the intervals were initially sorted according to their start
times.</p>
<h1>Example</h1>
<h2>Example 1:</h2>
<p>Given intervals [1,3],[6,9], insert and merge [2,5] in as [1,5],[6,9].</p>
<h2>Example 2:</h2>
<p>Given [1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16], insert and merge [4,9] in as
[1,2],[3,10],[12,16].</p>
<p>This is because the new interval [4,9] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].</p>
