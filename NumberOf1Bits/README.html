    <h1>Number of 1 Bits</h1>
<p>Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of ’1'
bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).</p>
<h1>For example</h1>
<p>the 32-bit integer ’11' has binary representation
00000000000000000000000000001011, so the function should return 3.</p>
