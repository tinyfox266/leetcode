    <h1>Intersection of Two Linked Lists</h1>
<p>Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.</p>
<h1>For example</h1>
<p>the following two linked lists:</p>
<pre>
A:          a1 → a2
                   ↘
                     c1 → c2 → c3
                   ↗            
B:     b1 → b2 → b3
</pre>

<p>begin to intersect at node c1.</p>
<h1>Notes:</h1>
<ul>
<li>If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.</li>
<li>The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.</li>
<li>You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.</li>
<li>Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.</li>
</ul>
