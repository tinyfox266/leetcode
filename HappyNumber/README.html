    <h1>Happy Number</h1>
<p>Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".</p>
<p>A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any
positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits,
and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it
loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which
this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.</p>
<h1>Example: 19 is a happy number</h1>
<p>12 + 92 = 82</p>
<p>82 + 22 = 68</p>
<p>62 + 82 = 100</p>
<p>12 + 02 + 02 = 1</p>
<h1>Note</h1>
<ul>
<li>when a number emegered in the middle process twice and it is not 1, then
    return false</li>
</ul>
