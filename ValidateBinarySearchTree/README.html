    <h1>Validate Binary Search Tree</h1>
<p>Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).</p>
<p>Assume a BST is defined as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's
    key.</li>
<li>The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the
    node's key.</li>
<li>Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.</li>
</ul>
