    <h1>Implement Queue using Stacks</h1>
<p>Implement the following operations of a queue using stacks.</p>
<ul>
<li>push(x) -- Push element x to the back of queue.</li>
<li>pop() -- Removes the element from in front of queue.</li>
<li>peek() -- Get the front element.</li>
<li>empty() -- Return whether the queue is empty.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Notes:</h1>
<ul>
<li>You must use only standard operations of a stack -- which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.</li>
<li>Depending on your language, stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a stack.</li>
<li>You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or peek operations will be called on an empty queue).</li>
</ul>
