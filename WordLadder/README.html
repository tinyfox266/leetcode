    <h1>Word Ladder</h1>
<p>Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary, find the length of
shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, such that:
<em> Only one letter can be changed at a time
</em> Each intermediate word must exist in the dictionary</p>
<h1>For example</h1>
<p>Given:</p>
<p>start = "hit"</p>
<p>end = "cog"</p>
<p>dict = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]</p>
<p>As one shortest transformation is "hit" -&gt; "hot" -&gt; "dot" -&gt; "dog" -&gt; "cog",
return its length 5.</p>
<h1>Note:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.</li>
<li>All words have the same length.</li>
<li>All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.</li>
</ul>
