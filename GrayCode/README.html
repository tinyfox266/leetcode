    <h1>Gray Code</h1>
<p>The gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.</p>
<p>Given a non-negative integer n representing the total number of bits in the code, print the sequence of gray code. A gray code sequence must begin with 0.</p>
<h1>For example</h1>
<p>given n = 2, return [0,1,3,2]. Its gray code sequence is:</p>
<p>00 - 0</p>
<p>01 - 1</p>
<p>11 - 3</p>
<p>10 - 2</p>
<h1>Note:</h1>
<p>For a given n, a gray code sequence is not uniquely defined.</p>
<p>For example, [0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence according to the above definition.</p>
<p>For now, the judge is able to judge based on one instance of gray code sequence. Sorry about that.</p>
