# Subsets 

Given a set of distinct integers, nums, return all possible subsets.

# For example,
If nums = [1,2,3], a solution is:

<pre>
[
  [3],
  [1],
  [2],
  [1,2,3],
  [1,3],
  [2,3],
  [1,2],
  []
]
</pre>

# Note:
Elements in a subset must be in non-descending order.
The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.
